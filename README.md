<h2> This is a script that automatically writes the text on play.typeracer.com </h2>
<h3> To use the hack, all you need to do is to paste the code in the console after the race started </h3>
<p> To open the console, you need to press F12, or press right-click and inspect, then choose the console bar </p>
<p> The typing speed can be modified by changing the time variable (500 = 0.5s), and do not set it lower than 50 <p>
<p> 240 is speed that gets around 85-99 words per minute, so you dont pass 100, because when you pass 100 you have to take an additional text </p>
<h2> Enjoy </h2>
